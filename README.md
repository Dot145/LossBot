# LossBot
A Discord bot that uses pre-trained neural networks to detect if an image is loss or not. Final project for CS 474 at BYU.

## TODO list:
- make LossBot react to pings to give a quick indication that it's online
- show "LossBot is typing..." after receiving an image and while waiting for the neural network to finish processing
